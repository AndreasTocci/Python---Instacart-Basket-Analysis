# Python - Instacart-Basket-Analysis

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation

# Objective

This project presents a comprehensive examination of Instacart's transaction data to reveal customer buying behaviors. Working as an Instacart analyst, I aim to generate valuable insights that can shape effective marketing initiatives. The investigation responds to specific inquiries from both marketing and sales departments, analyzing when order volume peaks throughout the week and day, how customer spending varies, and which departments see the highest product demand. The analysis extends to customer categorization, investigating how shopping habits differ based on brand preferences, geographic location, customer age, economic status, and household composition. These findings will enable Instacart to customize marketing efforts to connect with various customer groups more effectively, increase revenue, and deliver more personalized promotional content and advertising.

# Key Questions

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders. 

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
